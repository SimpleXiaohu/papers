This paper aims to efficiently solve the string constraints with bounded repetition and linear integer constraints on string length. The bounded repetition is encoded by an automaton model CEFA whose size is linear to the bound. Moreover, we extend the algorithm in the paper \cite{atva2020} with heuristics such as under-approximation and symbolic-aware simplification. The implementation of the algorithm is done on string solver OstrichCEA. The extensive empirical comparison against state-of-art string solvers over a large and diverse benchmark shows the power of our encoding for bounded repetition and heuristic ways. In the future, we plan to explore how to solve nested repetition and use CEFA to solve more string operations.
