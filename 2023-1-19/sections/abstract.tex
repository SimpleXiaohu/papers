Regular expression with repetition frequently appears in the real world, such as $(ab)\{1, 100\}$. However, state-of-art string
solvers can not efficiently solve string constraints with repetition bounds,
especially when the repetition bounds are large. This paper focuses on
string logic containing regular membership predicate with repetition
and linear integer constraints on string length. Repetition is captured
by cost-enriched finite automaton(CEFA), whose transitions have symbolic updates of integers limited by linear arithmetic. We propose a new systematic algorithm based on CEFA, and heuristic ways
like under-approximation and symbolic-aware simplification are used to
accelerate. We implement a powerful string solver OstrichCEA and
evaluate it on instances from the real world and other typical benchmarks.
The experiment result shows superiority.
